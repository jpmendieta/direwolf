    "My parents own a small pet grooming.  Over the years, we've incorporated more and more technology into the business, from setting up credit card terminals, to storing client information in a client management application.  We've never done any analytics on our clientele though. We have an idea of when our peak business months are, but we don't have any metrics to back it up.  Additionally,  every client has their own grooming schedule.  Some bring their pets every month, others once a year.  It would be really useful to get a better understanding of how often a client brings their pet and what factors influence their grooming schedule.  Knowing this will help us, in advance, prepare our inventory (how much shampoo should be ordered, the type of shampoo) and also shape our outreach initiatives.  Ideally, we would like to target and retain clients who are likely to bring their pets more frequently."

Alternatively,  I could categorize the pets by **size**.  If a dog is equal to or less than 30lbs, I can classify it as **small**.  If it is greater than 20lbs, I can classify it as **large**.  Instinctively, I can make the assumption that large dogs tend to be outside more often than small dogs.

This would be inaccurate though, since clients with the same last name would be grouped together.  A possible solution is to do a count of client last names and only use clients with unique last names.
